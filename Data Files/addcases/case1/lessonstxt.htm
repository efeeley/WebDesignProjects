      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <p>Weekly private lessons are 30, 45, or 60 minutes in length. Priority 
         scheduling is given to current students and enrollments received before 
         August 1st. Enrollment is on-going and tuition is pro-rated for a 
         mid-year start.</p>
      <p>Tuition includes 29 private lessons and 5 ensemble experiences from 
         September through June (see our calendar for exact dates). There are 
         two payment options available-Monthly and Semester. Monthly payments 
         are due the 1st of each month from August through May. Semester payments are 
         discounted and are due August 1st and January 1st. A late fee is applied 
         for past due accounts on the 7th of the month. Students beginning study 
         mid-year will have their tuition prorated.</p>
      <p>It is the goal of Young Notes that no student be unable to study the 
         arts due to financial challenges. Our Scholarship Program provides financial 
         assistance to students who are unable to pay full tuition.</p>


      <p>All students pay an annual registration fee: $30/person, $45/family.</p>
