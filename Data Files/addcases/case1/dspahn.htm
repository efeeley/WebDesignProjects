   <h1>David Spahn</h1>
   <h2 class="sub">Guitar, Keyboards, Composition</h2>

   <p>David Spahn started playing music at age 15, on a piano that came into 
      the household after his family moved to Texas. David was fascinated with 
      the instrument, and soon immersed himself in music. He always had an 
      interest in popular music and jazz, and taught himself to play the guitar 
      from the music theory he learned at his piano lessons.</p>
   <p>David attended East Texas State as a music major, where he studied theory 
      and composition with acclaimed composer William Turk. He also played and 
      toured with the East Texas State Jazz Ensemble. David has continued to 
      play and write music for a wide variety of styles, ranging from contemporary 
      Christian music to jazz fusion. He moved back to Brownwood last year, and 
      when not teaching for Young Notes, he plays keyboard and guitar for the 
      musical group, Southern Cross.</p>
