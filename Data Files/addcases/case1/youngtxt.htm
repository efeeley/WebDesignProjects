      <h2>The Young Notes Mission Statement</h2>

      <p>
         Young Notes is dedicated to the idea that everyone has the ability
         to perform and appreciate music and that a life begun with the gift
         of music will grow in joy.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>There are few things as rewarding as being able to play a role in 
         the growth of a student's musical talent. New doors open when a student 
         discovers a composer, attends a concert, learns a new piece, or performs 
         for an appreciative audience. We want our students to have a positive 
         experience, establish good practice habits, and have fun. We accept 
         the responsibility of providing the finest instruction for each of our 
         students, of continuing to study and practice our musical art, and 
         of being active members of the community, fully engaged in bringing music 
         to our neighbors.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose Young Notes?</h2>
      <p>The Young Notes music program is so much more than music lessons. We strive 
         to give our students the best music education possible. Here are a few things 
         that set us apart:</p>

      <ul>
         <li><strong>Family Friendly</strong> We have programs for everyone in your family! 
              With instruction for just about every instrument, we can arrange lessons
              for the whole family at one convenient time.</li>

         <li><strong>Highly Qualified Instructors</strong> Young Notes has some of the 
             area's best teachers. Take a look at our instructor bios.</li>

         <li><strong>Orientation Interviews</strong> Finding a good student/teacher match 
             is essential to a student's success. We offer "get to know you"
             complementary lessons to match each student to the right teacher.</li>

         <li><strong>Performance</strong> With an ongoing schedule of recitals, music 
             festivals, and contests (competitive and non-competitive), students have a
             chance to hone their performance skills in a friendly, supportive
             environment.</li>

         <li><strong>Open Rooms</strong> During specified hours you can come in and practice!
             Call our office to schedule a time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We look forward to seeing you soon at Young Notes!</p>
