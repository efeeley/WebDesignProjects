Multiple Births on the Increase
===============================

Incidences of multiple birth pregnancies have increased by 8% in the
past 10 years. The increase has been attributed to later pregnancies
by working mothers, which are more likely to result in twin births and
the increased use of fertility drugs. "Twins and even triplet births
are much more common these days, " says nurse Denise Schoeder of St.
Judes hospital in Beaverton, Illinois. "Fortunately we are much better
equipped to handle the special complications that arise with these
type of pregnancies than we were, even five years ago." Statistics
bear this out. Complications resulting from low birthweight babies
(a common occurence with multiple births) are down 25% in the past ten
years.

In Dade County, Florida, two quadruplets have been born in the past
18 months. "I think we'll need to increase the size of our marternity
ward if this keeps up," says Dr. Lawrence Jacobs of Miami Community
Hospital.

Sociologists worry about the effect of these multiple births on families
and parents. "Parents usually prepare for a single child. When they're
suddenly faced with a larger family than expected, it can cause stress
and tension." reports a study recently published in the American Journal
of Family Sociology.

Nonetheless, parents seem to recover from the surprise. "There's an
initial shock," reports Schoeder, "but after they get over that, parents
are usually very pleased. In fact, they begin to see the humor in the
situation. I think we tend to underestimate the coping abilities of
parents."
