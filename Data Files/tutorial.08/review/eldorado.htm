      <h2>Eldorado Canyon</h2>
      <p>Eldorado Canyon is not actually in Rocky Mountain National Park, but if you're 
         willing to take a 60-minute drive to this awesome state park, we can provide 
         some of the best climbing in Colorado. Choose from beginner climbs to more 
         advanced routes. Eldorado offers climbs of 400 to 600 feet, high on a solid
         rock wall. All climbs are only a short distance from the parking lot.
         No matter what your skill and experience, we'll tailor the Eldorado
         Canyon tour to fit you.</p>
