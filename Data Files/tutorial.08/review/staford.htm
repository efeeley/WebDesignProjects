      <h2>John Staford</h2>
      <p>John has led expeditions in South America, Nepal and Pakistan. Though he
         has lived practically everywhere, he still calls the Front Range his home. 
         He is one of the top climbers in the park and one of our most popular guides.
         John will be leading tours up the Petit Grepon and the Diamond.</p>
