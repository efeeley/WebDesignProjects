   <h2>Climbing Lessons</h2>
   <p>Here at Cliff Hangers we provide several levels of climbing instruction, 
      all tailored to your individual strengths, interests, and comfort levels. 
      You can start your lessons on small one- and two-pitch climbs and move up to longer
      routes. We cover everything from working with hand and footholds to working
      with ice axes. Lessons are always under the watchful and encouraging eye
      of an experienced instructor. Special instruction is also available for 
      those with special physical needs or requirements.</p>
   <p>NOTE: Students may be removed from the courses for safety reasons at any 
      time based on the discretion of the instructor. Partial refunds available
      for any uncompleted courses.</p>
