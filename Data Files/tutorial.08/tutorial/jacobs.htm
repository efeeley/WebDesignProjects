      <h2>Dennis Jacobs</h2>
      <p>Dennis is one of our original tour guides. This will be his
         fifteenth year with Cliff Hangers. He is best known for his inexhaustable 
         supply of stories about climbing, the mountains, and frontier
         days in the old West. Dennis will be leading tours up Kiener's and the North 
         Face of Longs Peak.</p>
