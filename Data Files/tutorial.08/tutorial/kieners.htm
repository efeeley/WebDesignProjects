      <h2>Longs Peak: Kiener's Route</h2>
      <p>One of the most awesome climbs in the park, yet still very accessible to
         the beginning climber, Kiener's Route is a Cliff Hangers favorite. The
         route starts at Mills Glacier and proceeds up a 1000-foot couloir known
         as Lamb's Slide (ice axes and crampons required to climb Lamb's Slide). Moving
         off Lamb's Slide, you are led across Broadway, a narrow ledge varying in
         width from several feet to six inches. The ledge overlooks a sheet of 
         granite plunging down to Chasm Lake far below.
         Proceeding up from Broadway, you will climb to the summit of Longs Peak 
         following a route requiring climbing gear and climbing technique. Kiener's 
         is one of North America's classic climbs.</p>
