   <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

   <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was 
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's 
work on mathematical analysis, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</cite> (1748) 
remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of 
Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.</p>

   <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, 
such as <i>e</i> and &pi;, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known 
for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula</p>


   <blockquote style="color: red; text-align: center">
       <i>cos(x) + isin(x) = <i>e <sup>(ix)</sup></i></i>
   </blockquote>


   <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry.
From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>


   <blockquote style="color: red; text-align: center">
    <i><i>e</i><sup>(&pi; <i>i</i>)</sup> + 1 = 0</i>
   </blockquote>


   <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single
beautiful and elegant statement.</p>


   <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
