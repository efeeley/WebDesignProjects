   <h2>Who am I?</h2>

   <p>Welcome to <b>Dave's Devil Sticks</b>. If you are looking for juggling balls, hacky sacks, pins, unicycles, or magic hats, you've come to the wrong place; but if you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted devil and flower sticks, this is the site for you. I've been designing and building sticks for the past 20 years, and I know that my sticks are the best of their kind. Don't take my word for it; read the following testimonial:</p>


   <blockquote>

      <p>I'm more than happy to recommend Dave Vinet'sm products. I came up on his work 10 years ago and was immediately impressed by his craftmanship. I've been using his sticks in my shows ever since. They're durable, well-balanced, and attractive props and are the perfect complement to my performances. Thanks Dave!</p>

   <p>Every set is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality. I take pride in every one of my sticks and I want my customers to feel that same pride.</p>

   <h2>My Products</h2>

   <ul>
      <li><b>Basic Stick</b><br />
         The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most deamnding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.</li>
      <li><b>Flower Stick</b><br />
         A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float more slowly, giving you the ideal chance to practice new moves.</li>
      <li><b>Master Stick</b><br />
         My most popilar stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master set is available in custom colors.</li>
      <li><b>Glow Stick</b><br />
         The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick). It combines the fun and versatility of the Master Stick, adding the fun tricks unique to a glow-in-the-dark stick.</li>
   </ul>
