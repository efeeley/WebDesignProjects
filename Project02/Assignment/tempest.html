[Enter <a href="cast.html#Alonso">Alonso</a>, <a href="cast.html#Sebastian">Sebastian</a>, <a href="cast.html#Antonio">Antonio</a>, <a href="cast.html#Gonzalo">Gonzalo</a>, <a href="cast.html#Adrian">Adrian</a>, <a href="cast.html#Francisco">Francisco</a>]
   GONZALO
      [To ALONSO]
   <a href= "commentary.html#_1">1</a>     By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
         My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
   <a href= "commentary.html#_3">3</a>     Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
         I needs must rest me.

   ALONSO 
          Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
   <a href= "commentary.html#_5">5</a>      Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
   <a href= "commentary.html#_6">6</a>      To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
   <a href= "commentary.html#_7">7</a>      Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
   <a href= "commentary.html#_8">8</a>      No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
          Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
   <a href= "commentary.html#_10">10</a>     Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

   ANTONIO 
      [Aside to SEBASTIAN]
          I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
   <a href= "commentary.html#_12">12</a>     Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
          That you resolved to effect.

   SEBASTIAN 
      [Aside to ANTONIO]
          The next advantage Will we take throughly.

   ANTONIO 
     [Aside to SEBASTIAN] 
         Let it be to-night;
  <a href= "commentary.html#_15">15</a>     For, now they are oppress'd with travail, they
         Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
         As when they are fresh.

   SEBASTIAN 
     [Aside to ANTONIO]
         I say, to-night: no more.

         Solemn and strange music

   ALONSO 
         What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

   GONZALO 
         Marvellous sweet music!

[Enter <a href="cast.html#Prospero">PROSPERO</a> above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; 
they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and company
to eat, they depart]

   ALONSO 
   <a href= "commentary.html#_20">20</a>     Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

   SEBASTIAN 
   <a href= "commentary.html#_21">21</a>     A living drollery. Now I will believe
          That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
          There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
          At this hour reigning there.

   ANTONIO 
         I'll believe both;
   <a href= "commentary.html#_25">25</a>    And what does else want credit, come to me,
   <a href= "commentary.html#_26">26</a>    And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
         lie,
         Though fools at home condemn 'em.

   GONZALO 
         If in Naples
         I should report this now, would they believe me?
         If I should say, I saw such islanders--
   <a href= "commentary.html#_30">30</a>    For, certes, these are people of the island--
         Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
   <a href= "commentary.html#_32">32</a>    Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
         Our human generation you shall find
         Many, nay, almost any.

   PROSPERO 
      [Aside] Honest lord,
         Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
         Are worse than devils.
